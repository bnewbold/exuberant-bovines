general:
- mouse/keyboard interaction
- wireframe mode
- FPS printing
- shadertoy example program (maybe util helper?)

bovines:
- textures/colors
- bouncy!
- refactor code into inline routines

variants:
- zoom over a grid landscape of cows which are watching you
- wiremesh rendering
- N-body problems
- "skinless" mode

later:
- merge entire cow into a single vertexbuffer (including color?)
